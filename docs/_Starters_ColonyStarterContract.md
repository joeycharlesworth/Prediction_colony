_A boilerplate to start building extension contracts alongside [colonyNetwork](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork)!_

## Prerequisites

- Node `>=10.13.0`
- Yarn `>=1.12.0`
- Docker `>=18.09.0`

_You may find it helpful to use Node Version Manager (`nvm`) to manage Node versions._

_If you are using Linux, check out [Linux Setup](/colonystarter/docs-linux-setup/) to ensure Yarn and Docker are set up accordingly._

## Installation

Globally install the [colony-cli](/colonystarter/cli-colony-cli) package.

```
yarn global add @colony/colony-cli
```

Install the `colony-starter-contract` package.

```
colony build colony-starter-contract
```

Alternatively, you can use [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) and kickstart the `colony-starter-contract` package in one line without having to globally add the [colony-cli](/colonystarter/cli-colony-cli) package:

```
npx -p @colony/colony-cli colony build colony-starter-contract
```

## Start Ganache

Open a new terminal window and start [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli):

```
yarn start-ganache
```

## Deploy Contracts

Open a new terminal window and deploy the [colonyNetwork](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork) contracts:

```
yarn deploy-contracts
```

## Start TrufflePig

Once the contracts have been deployed, start [TrufflePig](https://github.com/JoinColony/trufflepig):

```
yarn start-trufflepig
```

## Colony Setup

Open a new terminal window and create a test colony:

```
yarn colony-setup
```

## Truffle Commands

Run `truffle` commands using [colony-cli](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyStarter/tree/master/packages/colony-cli):

```
yarn truffle [develop/compile/migrate/test]
```

## Contract Versions

If you do not want to use the default version of the [colonyNetwork](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork) smart contracts defined by the [colony-cli](/colonystarter/colony-cli) package, you can update the `"deploy-contracts"` scripts property in your `package.json` file to use a specific version. This can be a branch name, a commit hash, or a version tag.

```
"deploy-contracts": "colony service deploy-contracts --specific glider",
```
