# Colony Starter

_Get a head start on your next project!_ Colony Starter (formerly known as "Hackathon Starter") includes a variety of boilerplates and example projects that will help you get started with Colony.

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

- Node `>=10.13.0`
- Yarn `>=1.12.0`
- Docker `>=18.09.0`

_You may find it helpful to use Node Version Manager (`nvm`) to manage Node versions._

_If you are using Linux, check out [Linux Setup](/.github/LINUX_SETUP.md) to ensure Yarn and Docker are set up accordingly._

### Step 1

Globally install the [colony-cli](/packages/colony-cli) package:

```
yarn global add @colony/colony-cli
```

### Step 2

Move to your working directory and unpack the [colony-starter](/packages/colony-starter) package:

```
colony build colony-starter
```

### Step 3

Move to your new project directory and check out the [colony-starter](/packages/colony-starter) readme for further instructions:

```
cd colony-starter
```

### Using NPX

Alternatively, you can use [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) and unpack the [colony-starter](/packages/colony-starter) package without installing the [colony-cli](/packages/colony-cli) package.

```
npx -p @colony/colony-cli colony build colony-starter
```

## Packages

### Colony CLI
