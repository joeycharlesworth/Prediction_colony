_An example project using [colonyJS](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyJS) with Vue!_

This is a built out version of the [colony-starter-vue](/colonystarter/starters-colony-starter-vue) package with more examples.

## Prerequisites

- Node `>=10.13.0`
- Yarn `>=1.12.0`
- Docker `>=18.09.0`

_You may find it helpful to use Node Version Manager (`nvm`) to manage Node versions._

_If you are using Linux, check out [Linux Setup](/colonystarter/docs-linux-setup/) to ensure Yarn and Docker are set up accordingly._

```
yarn global add @colony/colony-cli

```

Alternatively, you can use [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) and kickstart the `colony-example-vue` package in one line without having to add the [colony-cli](/cli-colony-cli) package:

```
npx -p @colony/colony-starter colony build colony-example-vue
